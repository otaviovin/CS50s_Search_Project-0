    Finds the shortest path between two actors (source and target) in terms of co-starring in movies.

    Parameters:
        source (str): The IMDb ID of the source actor.

    Returns:
        list of tuples: Each tuple is (movie_id, person_id) representing

    Overview:
        This function implements a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest
        connection path between two actors. BFS ensures the shortest path is found because it
        explores all neighbors at the current depth before moving to the next level.
